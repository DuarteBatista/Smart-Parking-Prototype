## Description

Smart Parking Prototype was a project developed for the Internet Technologies curricular unit of the Computer Engineering course at the Polytechnic of Leiria, the grade given to this project was 18 (eighteen, in a scale of 0 to 20). The main objective of this work was to develop an IoT solution interconnected with a smart parking lot. To do this, a website was created, developed in PHP, which allowed users to view the status of the sensors and actuators installed in the parking lot according to their privileges. The parking lot was simulated using the cisco packet tracer software, which contains several sensors and actuators that allowed us to simulate an IoT environment in the parking lot. Some functions, such as making music available on the site, greeting those arriving at the car park with a voice, and taking photos with the webcam, are done using python scripts

Sensors used in the parking lot:
  - Humidity
  - Places available for disabled people
  - Places available for normal people
  - Temperature
  - Amount of smoke
  - Movement at the gate

Actuators used in the parking lot:
  - Gate
  - Smoke status alarm
  - Air conditioning
  - Led open and close gate
  - LCD to display messages
