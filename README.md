## Description

Smart Parking Protorype was a project developed for the Internet Technologies curricular unit of the Computer Engineering course at the Polytechnic of Leiria. The main objective of this work was to develop an IoT solution interconnected with a smart parking lot. To do this, a website was created, developed in PHP, which allowed users to view the status of the sensors and actuators installed in the parking lot according to their privileges. The parking lot was simulated using the cisco packet tracer software, which contains several sensors and actuators that allowed us to simulate the parking lot.
